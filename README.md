Performed EDA on a home loan dataset and created visualizations using seaborn library to analyze the factors affecting home loan eligibility.

Factors affecting Customer’s eligibility are:
Credit Score:
A healthy credit score of 750 and above can directly impact home loan interests offered to you. It also allows lenders to use this measure to decide whether to approve a loan or not.
Existing Debt Obligations:
Unpaid dues or missing the EMI deadlines play a major role for the lenders to decide the approval of the loan.
Applicant Income:
Based on the city of the applicant, the lender sets a minimum income criterion for approving the loan.
Employment Status:
Just like the income, employment status is also important and a factor for approving loans.
Age & Educational Background:
These also have a role to decide for the lender for approving the loan.
